Java Ding Sound

Hello! This is the Ding Sound Plugin, a Minecraft Bedrock add-on developed to provide a missing feature. It allows players to hear a ding sound when they hit another player with an arrow, egg, trident, or snowball, just like in the Java edition.

This plugin is designed to provide a more fun experience for players who are playing in the Bedrock edition. It is particularly useful in competitive environments, such as PVP matches or mini-games.

The installation of the plugin is straightforward and can be completed in just a few steps. After downloading it, you can upload the add-on to your server and start using it right away.

We hope this add-on provides a fun feature for players who are playing Minecraft Bedrock and improves their gameplay experience. If you have any feedback, please let us know. Thank you!
